# Part 4: Multi-Agent Systems

> Goal for this stage: **Build collaborative architecture.** Understand why multiple expert Agents are needed, how to design their division of labor and collaboration, and how Risk Agent has veto power.

## After Completing This Stage

You will be able to:
- Design multi-Agent architecture: Meta Agent, Expert Agents, Risk Agent
- Implement Regime Detection: identify trending, ranging, and crisis markets
- Understand five patterns of Regime misjudgment and response strategies
- Understand the correct use of LLM (enhancement, not replacement)
- Build multi-layer risk control systems with Risk Agent veto power
- Design the portfolio layer: Position Sizing, factor exposure monitoring
- Design online learning and strategy elimination mechanisms
